# About

This "creators" website is actually a blog website, as the name implies, it is not contributed by one personal but by multiple people, therefore, named as "creators".

The idea is, it is very hard to generate abundant information to attract audiences for a single person due to the limited time and knowledge, hence we have this website setup with a group of friends who are all interested in blogging jointly to contribute the content. Different contributor will have different interests and specialty, this will help to bring more interesting topics, as they are also content consumer, it will naturally brings more traffic to the website.

It requires the articles published on this website to be original; we do not allow to copy and paste from others. The topics can vary by every contributor's interests or specialty, and ideally every post will have a minimum of 1 week of effort to ensure the quality and depth.

The language used in posts can be English or Chinese, depending on the contributors' will and target audiences.

The copyright of the post still belongs to the original author, this website is just a place for publishing and sharing. We made it clear here that this website and its owner will not responsible for any legal issues or consequences caused by any post, and we reserve the rights to delete any post we think is not appropriate here, with no need for confirmation from the contributor.

Welcome to Creators Blog and happy blogging!
