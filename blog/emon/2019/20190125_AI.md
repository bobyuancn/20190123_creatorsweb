# Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks. Most AI examples you hear about today, from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars, rely heavily on deep learning and [natural language processing](https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/what-is-natural-language-processing-nlp.html). Using these technologies, we can train computers to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data.

## History 

The term artificial intelligence was coined in 1956, but AI has become more popular today thanks to increased data volumes, advanced algorithms, and improvements in computing power and storage.

Early AI research in the 1950s explored topics like problem-solving and symbolic methods. In the 1960s, the US Department of Defense took an interest in this work and trained computers to mimic basic human reasoning. For example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) completed street mapping projects in the 1970s. And DARPA produced intelligent personal assistants in 2003, long before Siri, Alexa or Cortana were household names.

## Importance

Artificial intelligence systems are critical for companies looking to extract value from data by automating and optimizing processes or producing actionable [insights](https://www.datarobot.com/wiki/insights/). Artificial intelligence systems powered by [machine learning](https://www.datarobot.com/wiki/machine-learning/) enable companies to leverage their large amounts of data available to uncover insights and patterns that would be impossible for any one person to tease out, enabling them to deliver more targeted, personalized communications, predict critical care events, identify likely fraudulent transactions, and [more](https://www.datarobot.com/use-cases/).

## How AI works?

There is no single way in which artificial intelligence works. One definition of AI is when a computer can solve a problem that normally requires a level of intelligence. Over the past 60 years, AI researchers discovered many approaches to solving a wide variety of problems. For example, computers can now play chess such as Deep Blue at a Grand Master level. It works by examining many thousands of chess board configurations, to see the future result of making particular moves. Another example is expert systems, which solve problems in areas such as medicine and engineering by duplicating the problem solving performed by real human experts. Other problems are more difficult. For example, making computers read and communicate in English is very challenging, and is far from solved.

## The Future

With the smooth integration of artificial intelligence into our daily lives, we are now living in the era we used to watch in sci-fi movies. All the mesmerizing inventions in those movies are “given” now, and it is getting harder to blow our minds when the self-driving and talking dream car of our childhoods “KITT -in Knight Rider” is just a “car”, and those futuristic video calls in “Back to the Future” became just ordinary daily calls for us.

Well, we might not be wowed that easily nowadays, however the future of Artificial Intelligence is looking interesting for 2018 and the near future with the attempts to apply [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) to problems, which enables machines to model human psychology to make better predictions; or contesting neural networks with [generative adversarial networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_networks) algorithms which requires less human supervision and enables computers to learn from unlabeled data; making them more intelligent.

## Summary

Artificial Intelligence is one of the fast developing technology in the world. AI is the best field for dreamers to play around, they believe making a human-machine is possible. Though many conclude that this is not possible, there is still a lot of [research](http://www.jair.org/) going on in this field to attain the final aim. There are inherent advantages of using computers as they do not get tired or loosing temper and are becoming faster and faster. Only time will say what will be the future of AI: will it attain human-level or above human-level intelligence or not?
