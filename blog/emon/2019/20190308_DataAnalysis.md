# Data Analysis


## Definition

The [process](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/process.html) of evaluating [data](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/data.html) using analytical and logical reasoning to [examine](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/examine.html) each [component](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/component.html) of the data provided. This [form](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/form.html) of [analysis](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/analysis.html) is just one of the many steps that must be [completed](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/completed.html) when conducting a [research](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/research.html) [experiment](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/experiment.html). Data from various sources is gathered, reviewed, and then analyzed to form some sort of finding or conclusion. There are a variety of specific data analysis [method](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/method.html), some of which include [data mining](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/data-mining.html), text [analytics](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/analytics.html), business intelligence, and data visualizations.

## How Is Data Analysis Performed?

[Data analysis](https://www.makeuseof.com/service/productivity/) is a part of a larger process of deriving business intelligence. The process includes one or more of the following steps:

Defining Objectives: Any study must begin with a set of clearly defined business objectives. Much of the decisions made in the rest of the process depends on how clearly the objectives of the study have been stated.

* Posing Questions: An attempt is made to ask a question in the problem domain. For example, do red sports cars get into accidents more often than others?

* Data Collection: Data relevant to the question must be collected from the appropriate sources. In the example above, data might be collected from a variety of sources including: DMV or police accident reports, insurance claims and hospitalization details. When data is being collected using surveys, a questionnaire to be presented to the subjects is needed. The questions should be appropriately modeled for the statistical method being used.

* Data Wrangling: Raw data may be collected in several different formats. The collected data must be cleaned and converted so that data analysis tools can import it. For our example, we may receive DMV accident reports as text files, insurance claims from a relational database and hospitalization details as an API. The data analyst must aggregate these different forms of data and convert it into a form suitable for the analysis tools.

* Data Analysis: This is the step where the cleaned and aggregated data is imported into analysis tools. These tools allow you to explore the data, find patterns in it, and ask and answer what-if questions. This is the process by which sense is made of data gathered in research by proper application of statistical methods.

* Drawing Conclusions and Making Predictions: This is the step where, after sufficient analysis, conclusions can be drawn from the data and appropriate predictions can be made. These conclusions and predication's may then be summarized in a report delivered to end-users.



## Data Mining

Data mining is a method of data analysis for discovering patterns in large data sets [using the methods](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/become-data-scientist/) of statistics, artificial intelligence, machine learning and databases. The goal is to transform raw data into understandable business information. These might include identifying groups of data records (also known as cluster analysis), or identifying anomalies and dependencies between data groups.



## Text Analytics

Text analytics is the process of deriving useful information from text. It is accomplished by processing unstructured textual information, [extract meaningful numerical](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/saving-time-text-operations-excel/) indices from the information and make the information available to statistical and machine learning algorithms for further processing.

Text mining process includes one or more of the following steps:

* Collecting information from various sources including web, file system, database, etc.

* Linguistic analysis including natural language processing.

* Pattern recognition (e.g. recognizing phone numbers, email addresses, etc.)

* Extracting summary information from the text, such as relative frequencies of the words, determining similarities between documents, etc.



## Business Intelligence

[Business intelligence](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/use-cortana-analyze-data-power-bi/) transforms data into actionable intelligence for business purposes and may be used in an organization’s strategic and tactical business decision making. It offers a way for people to examine trends from collected data and derive insights from it.

Some examples of business intelligence in used today:

* An organization’s operating decisions such as product placement and pricing.

* Identifying new markets, assessing the demand and suitability of products for different market segments.

* Budgeting and rolling forecasts.

* Using visual tools such as heat maps, pivot tables and geographical mapping.



## Data Visualization

[Data visualization](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/instantly-visualize-data-information-google-fusion-tables/) refers to the visual representation of data. In data analysis, it means using the tools of statistics, probability, pivot tables and other artifacts to present data visually. It makes complex data more understandable and usable.
